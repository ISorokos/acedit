This page provides instructions on how to install and test the *acedit* for developers.

= Installation =

==Install Eclipse==

The [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/indigosr2 Eclipse Modeling Tools] distribution is recommended, in which the tool was implemented and tested. In addition this version of Eclipse contains some of the prerequisites for the *acedit*.

==Install the necessary Eclipse plugins==

The update sites you will need to install the plugins are:

 * http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/gmp/gmf-tooling/updates/releases/ . Installs the Graphical Model Framework tools
 * http://download.eclipse.org/epsilon/updates/ . Installs the Epsilon framework
 * http://download.eclipse.org/emfatic/update . Installs the Emfatic

----

==Install the Assurance Case Argument Editor==

The last step is to download the acedit projects into your eclipse workspace. The source code is available in this website. There many ways to download the code in eclipse. I suggest to use the Eclipse plugin for SVN:
 * Install the subeclipse in Eclipse from the update site : http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.8.x
 * Download the project from the SVN following these steps in Eclipse:
 # File -> new -> project
 # Choose the SVN folder
 # Choose the "Checkout Projects from SVN" option
 # press Next
 # Choose "Create a new repository location"
 # press Next
 # type the Url that is provided in the [http://code.google.com/p/acedit/source/checkout Source] section of this site
 # follow the instructions of the wizard to download the code into your Eclpse workspace from the SVN repository.

=Test the tool=

After you successfully install the the necessary plug-ins and the code you must be able to test the tool by executing the following steps:

 # Launch a new eclipse instance from the "Run - Eclipse Application" menu using "-XX:PermSize=64M -XX:MaxPermSize=128M -Xms512M -Xmx1024M" as VM arguments in the Run Configuration
 # select File->new->project
 # select General-> Project
 # select next and give a name to your project
 # select finish
 # press right click in the created project
 # select New->Other
 # in the pop up wizard type GSN
 # select GSN1 diagram
 # select Next-> Finish

You must be able to see the acedit editor in your workspace and start testing the tool!
