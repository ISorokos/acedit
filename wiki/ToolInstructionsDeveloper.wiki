The update sites you will need to install the plugins are:

The last step is to download the acedit projects into your eclipse workspace. The source code is available in this website. There many ways to download the code in eclipse. I suggest to use the Eclipse plugin for SVN:
 * Install the subeclipse in Eclipse from the update site : http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.8.x
 * Download the project from the SVN following these steps in Eclipse:
 # File -> new -> project
 # Choose the SVN folder
 # Choose the "Checkout Projects from SVN" option
 # press Next
 # Choose "Create a new repository location"
 # press Next
 # type the Url that is provided in the [http://code.google.com/p/acedit/source/checkout Source] section of this site
 # follow the instructions of the wizard to download the code into your Eclpse workspace from the SVN repository.
