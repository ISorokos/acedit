= Introduction =

This page lists all the changes that were done over the generated GMF code for both the GSN and ARM diagrams. The purpose of the modification of the generated code was to satisfy the requirements in order to reach the desired result. 

= Changes over the generated GMF code for GSN=

This sections lists the modifications over the generated code for GSN. The reasons of modifications are explained following by the code that was added/replaced in specific classes.

== Modifications over the GSN edit parts==

The default functionality for modifying the displaying of GSN diagrams did not permit to change the appearance of an element according to changes in its attributes. That wasnâ€™t sufficient, since elements such as the Goal has to render differently according to its status that is related with the GSN extensions (public, undeveloped etc ). The following modification were done:

=== Assumption Edit Part class ===
In package GSN1.diagram.edit.parts
class: *AssumptionEditPart*

 # the method: protected void handleNotificationEvent(Notification event) was replaced with the following:

{{{
@Override
	protected void handleNotificationEvent(Notification event) {
		  if (event.getNotifier() == getModel()
			      && EcorePackage.eINSTANCE.getEModelElement_EAnnotations()
			          .equals(event.getFeature())) {
			    handleMajorSemanticChange();
			  } else {

			    if (event.getNotifier() instanceof Assumption) {
			     
			    	Assumption assumption = (Assumption) ( (Node) this.getModel()).getElement();
			    	
			    	if (assumption.getTobeinstantiated()==true){ 
			    		AssumptionFigure figure = (AssumptionFigure) this.getPrimaryShape();
				    	  figure.setShape(1);
				  	}
			  		else{
			  			AssumptionFigure figure = (AssumptionFigure) this.getPrimaryShape();
				    	  figure.setShape(0);
			  		}
			    
			    }
			    super.handleNotificationEvent(event);
			  }
	}
